                      <p class="lead">British-Irish male vocal group whose stylish good looks and bright pop-rock sound captivated young fans around the world in the early 2010s. The members were Niall Horan (b. September 13, 1993, Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland), Zayn Malik (b. January 12, 1993, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England), Liam Payne (b. August 29, 1993, Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England), Harry Styles (b. February 1, 1994, Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, England), and Louis Tomlinson (b. December 24, 1991, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England).
                        The group formed in 2010 on the British television show The X Factor, a talent contest for aspiring singers. Each of the five members auditioned and originally competed as a solo performer, but early in the season they were advised to pool their talents. Taking the name One Direction, the boys—all were between 16 and 18 years old at the time—attracted substantial attention, especially from young female viewers, for their charismatic stage presence and vocal skills. Although One Direction ultimately fell short of winning on The X Factor, the show’s mastermind, Simon Cowell, offered the act a recording contract soon after the season ended. In the tradition of earlier pop-music “boy bands,” One Direction was promoted as a set of teen idols who were musically compatible but also distinct in style and personality. After building its fan base in early 2011 by touring the British Isles with fellow The X Factor contestants, the group entered the recording studio. The resulting album, Up All Night (2011), filled with cheerily harmonized pop songs about carefree revelry, first-time heartbreak, and other adolescent concerns, was an immediate hit both at home and in other European and Commonwealth countries. Its popularity was fueled in part by the song “What Makes You Beautiful,” a buoyant empowerment anthem that topped the British and Irish singles charts and in early 2012 was named best British single at the Brit Awards (the British equivalent of the Grammy Awards).
